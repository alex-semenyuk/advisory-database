  "details": "The Rust Programming Language rustdoc version Between 0.8 and 1.27.0 contains a CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability in rustdoc plugins that can result in local code execution as a different user. This attack appear to be exploitable via using the --plugin flag without the --plugin-path flag. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.27.1.\n\n\nThe problem was in rustdocâ€™s obscure plugin functionality, consisting of its loading plugins from a path that is globally writable on most platforms, /tmp/rustdoc/plugins. This feature permitted a malicious actor to write a dynamic library into this path and have another user execute that code. The security issue only happens if you're actively using the feature, and so this behavior will be removed from rustdoc in the near future, with patches landing for each channel over the next week. The plugin infrastructure predates 1.0 and is not usable on stable or nightly Rust today. Its removal should not impact any Rust users.",
